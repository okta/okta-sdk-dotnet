# Okta.Sdk.Model.CreateUserRequestType
The ID of the user type. Add this value if you want to create a user with a non-default [user type](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/). The user type determines which [schema](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/) applies to that user. After a user has been created, the user can  only be assigned a different user type by an administrator through a full replacement (`PUT`) operation.
