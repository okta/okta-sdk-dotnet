[Okta](https://developer.okta.com) is a cloud-hosted user management service. Okta security stores user profiles, manages password, and handles authentication and authorization so you can get back to building your application.

The [Okta .NET SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet) provides C# and VB.NET developers an easy way to use the [Okta Management API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/) from .NET projects.

## Installing the SDK

You can install the [Okta.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Okta.Sdk) package with the NuGet Package Manager, or on the command line:

In the Package Manager Console, run `Install-Package Okta.Sdk`.

If you are using the dotnet CLI, run `dotnet nuget package add --package Okta.Sdk`.

## Getting started

After installing the SDK, see the [quickstart](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet#okta-net-sdk) for a brief introduction.
