# Okta.Sdk.Model.PolicyType
All Okta orgs contain only one IdP Discovery Policy with an immutable default Rule routing to your org's sign-in page.  Creating or replacing a policy with `IDP_DISCOVERY` type isn't supported. The following policy types are available with the Okta Identity Engine: `ACCESS_POLICY`, `PROFILE_ENROLLMENT`, `CONTINUOUS_ACCESS`, and `ENTITY_RISK`. The `CONTINUOUS_ACCESS`, and `ENTITY_RISK`  policy types are in Early Access (EA). Contact your Okta account team to enable these features.
