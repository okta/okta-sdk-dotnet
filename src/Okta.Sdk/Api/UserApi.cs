You, and you alone, bear responsibility for the emails sent to any recipients.  All responses return the created user. Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation. The system performs group reconciliation during activation and assigns the user to all apps via direct or indirect relationships (group memberships). * The user&#39;s &#x60;transitioningToStatus&#x60; property is &#x60;ACTIVE&#x60; during activation to indicate that the user hasn&#39;t completed the asynchronous operation. * The user&#39;s &#x60;status&#x60; is &#x60;ACTIVE&#x60; when the activation process is complete.  The user is emailed a one-time activation token if activated without a password.  &gt; **Note:** If the user is assigned to an app that is configured for provisioning, the activation process triggers downstream provisioning to the app.  It is possible for a user to sign in before these apps have been successfully provisioned for the user.  &gt; **Important:** Do not generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an assigned password. Users should sign in with their assigned password.

Okta recommends using this parameter for optimal search performance.   &gt; **Note:** Using an overly complex or long search query can result in an error.  This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). Use an ID lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data. Returned users include those with the &#x60;DEPROVISIONED&#x60; status.  Property names in the search parameter are case sensitive, whereas operators (&#x60;eq&#x60;, &#x60;sw&#x60;, and so on) and string values are case insensitive. Unlike with user logins, diacritical marks are significant in search string values: a search for &#x60;isaac.brock&#x60; finds &#x60;Isaac.Brock&#x60;, but doesn&#39;t find a property whose value is &#x60;isáàc.bröck&#x60;.   This operation requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.department eq \&quot;Engineering\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.department%20eq%20%22Engineering%22&#x60;. If you use the special character &#x60;\&quot;&#x60; within a quoted string, it must also be escaped &#x60;\\&#x60; and encoded. For example, &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.lastName eq \&quot;bob\&quot;smith\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.lastName%20eq%20%22bob%5C%22smith%22&#x60;. See [Special Characters](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#special-characters).  This operation searches many properties:   * Any user profile attribute, including custom-defined attributes   * The top-level properties: &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;status&#x60;, &#x60;created&#x60;, &#x60;activated&#x60;, &#x60;statusChanged&#x60;, and &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;   * The [user type](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/#tag/UserType/operation/updateUserType) accessed as &#x60;type.id&#x60;  &gt; **Note:** &lt;x-lifecycle class&#x3D;\&quot;ea\&quot;&gt;&lt;/x-lifecycle&gt; The ability to search by user classification is available as an [Early Access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature. The &#x60;classification.type&#x60; property cannot be used in conjunction with other search terms. You can search using &#x60;classification.type eq \&quot;LITE\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;classification.type eq \&quot;STANDARD\&quot;&#x60;.  You can also use &#x60;sortBy&#x60; and &#x60;sortOrder&#x60; parameters. The &#x60;ne&#x60; (not equal) operator isn&#39;t supported, but you can obtain the same result by using &#x60;lt ... or ... gt&#x60;. For example, to see all users except those that have a status of &#x60;STAGED&#x60;, use &#x60;(status lt \&quot;STAGED\&quot; or status gt \&quot;STAGED\&quot;)&#x60;.  You can search properties that are arrays. If any element matches the search term, the entire array (object) is returned. Okta follows the [SCIM Protocol Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) for searching arrays. You can search multiple arrays, multiple values in an array, as well as using the standard logical and filtering operators. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter).  Searches for users can be filtered by the following operators: &#x60;sw&#x60;, &#x60;eq&#x60;, and &#x60;co&#x60;. You can only use &#x60;co&#x60; with these select user profile attributes: &#x60;profile.firstName&#x60;, &#x60;profile.lastName&#x60;, &#x60;profile.email&#x60;, and &#x60;profile.login&#x60;.

For example, &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated gt \&quot;2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated%20gt%20%222013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z%22&#x60;. Filtering is case-sensitive for property names and query values, while operators are case-insensitive.  Filtering supports the following limited number of properties: &#x60;status&#x60;, &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;, &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;profile.login&#x60;, &#x60;profile.email&#x60;, &#x60;profile.firstName&#x60;, and &#x60;profile.lastName&#x60;.  Additionally, filtering supports only the equal &#x60;eq&#x60; operator from the standard Okta API filtering semantics, except in the case of the &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60; property. This property can also use the inequality operators (&#x60;gt&#x60;, &#x60;ge&#x60;, &#x60;lt&#x60;, and &#x60;le&#x60;). For logical operators, only the logical operators &#x60;and&#x60; and &#x60;or&#x60; are supported. The &#x60;not&#x60; operator isn&#39;t supported.

        /// <param name="search">Searches for users with a supported filtering expression for most properties. Okta recommends using this parameter for optimal search performance.   &gt; **Note:** Using an overly complex or long search query can result in an error.  This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). Use an ID lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data. Returned users include those with the &#x60;DEPROVISIONED&#x60; status.  Property names in the search parameter are case sensitive, whereas operators (&#x60;eq&#x60;, &#x60;sw&#x60;, and so on) and string values are case insensitive. Unlike with user logins, diacritical marks are significant in search string values: a search for &#x60;isaac.brock&#x60; finds &#x60;Isaac.Brock&#x60;, but doesn&#39;t find a property whose value is &#x60;isáàc.bröck&#x60;.   This operation requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.department eq \&quot;Engineering\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.department%20eq%20%22Engineering%22&#x60;. If you use the special character &#x60;\&quot;&#x60; within a quoted string, it must also be escaped &#x60;\\&#x60; and encoded. For example, &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.lastName eq \&quot;bob\&quot;smith\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.lastName%20eq%20%22bob%5C%22smith%22&#x60;. See [Special Characters](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#special-characters).  This operation searches many properties:   * Any user profile attribute, including custom-defined attributes   * The top-level properties: &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;status&#x60;, &#x60;created&#x60;, &#x60;activated&#x60;, &#x60;statusChanged&#x60;, and &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;   * The [user type](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/#tag/UserType/operation/updateUserType) accessed as &#x60;type.id&#x60;  &gt; **Note:** &lt;x-lifecycle class&#x3D;\&quot;ea\&quot;&gt;&lt;/x-lifecycle&gt; The ability to search by user classification is available as an [Early Access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature. The &#x60;classification.type&#x60; property cannot be used in conjunction with other search terms. You can search using &#x60;classification.type eq \&quot;LITE\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;classification.type eq \&quot;STANDARD\&quot;&#x60;.  You can also use &#x60;sortBy&#x60; and &#x60;sortOrder&#x60; parameters. The &#x60;ne&#x60; (not equal) operator isn&#39;t supported, but you can obtain the same result by using &#x60;lt ... or ... gt&#x60;. For example, to see all users except those that have a status of &#x60;STAGED&#x60;, use &#x60;(status lt \&quot;STAGED\&quot; or status gt \&quot;STAGED\&quot;)&#x60;.  You can search properties that are arrays. If any element matches the search term, the entire array (object) is returned. Okta follows the [SCIM Protocol Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) for searching arrays. You can search multiple arrays, multiple values in an array, as well as using the standard logical and filtering operators. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter).  Searches for users can be filtered by the following operators: &#x60;sw&#x60;, &#x60;eq&#x60;, and &#x60;co&#x60;. You can only use &#x60;co&#x60; with these select user profile attributes: &#x60;profile.firstName&#x60;, &#x60;profile.lastName&#x60;, &#x60;profile.email&#x60;, and &#x60;profile.login&#x60;. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators). (optional)</param>
        /// <param name="filter">Filters users with a supported expression for a subset of properties.   &gt; **Note:** Returned users include those with the &#x60;DEPROVISIONED&#x60; status.  This requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated gt \&quot;2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated%20gt%20%222013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z%22&#x60;. Filtering is case-sensitive for property names and query values, while operators are case-insensitive.  Filtering supports the following limited number of properties: &#x60;status&#x60;, &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;, &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;profile.login&#x60;, &#x60;profile.email&#x60;, &#x60;profile.firstName&#x60;, and &#x60;profile.lastName&#x60;.  Additionally, filtering supports only the equal &#x60;eq&#x60; operator from the standard Okta API filtering semantics, except in the case of the &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60; property. This property can also use the inequality operators (&#x60;gt&#x60;, &#x60;ge&#x60;, &#x60;lt&#x60;, and &#x60;le&#x60;). For logical operators, only the logical operators &#x60;and&#x60; and &#x60;or&#x60; are supported. The &#x60;not&#x60; operator isn&#39;t supported. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter) and [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators). (optional)</param>

Use the &#x60;q&#x60; parameter for simple queries, such as a lookup of users by name when creating a people picker.  The value of &#x60;q&#x60; is matched against &#x60;firstName&#x60;, &#x60;lastName&#x60;, or &#x60;email&#x60;. This performs a &#x60;startsWith&#x60; match, but this is an implementation detail and can change without notice.

Okta recommends using this parameter for optimal search performance.   &gt; **Note:** Using an overly complex or long search query can result in an error.  This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). Use an ID lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data. Returned users include those with the &#x60;DEPROVISIONED&#x60; status.  Property names in the search parameter are case sensitive, whereas operators (&#x60;eq&#x60;, &#x60;sw&#x60;, and so on) and string values are case insensitive. Unlike with user logins, diacritical marks are significant in search string values: a search for &#x60;isaac.brock&#x60; finds &#x60;Isaac.Brock&#x60;, but doesn&#39;t find a property whose value is &#x60;isáàc.bröck&#x60;.   This operation requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.department eq \&quot;Engineering\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.department%20eq%20%22Engineering%22&#x60;. If you use the special character &#x60;\&quot;&#x60; within a quoted string, it must also be escaped &#x60;\\&#x60; and encoded. For example, &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.lastName eq \&quot;bob\&quot;smith\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.lastName%20eq%20%22bob%5C%22smith%22&#x60;. See [Special Characters](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#special-characters).  This operation searches many properties:   * Any user profile attribute, including custom-defined attributes   * The top-level properties: &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;status&#x60;, &#x60;created&#x60;, &#x60;activated&#x60;, &#x60;statusChanged&#x60;, and &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;   * The [user type](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/#tag/UserType/operation/updateUserType) accessed as &#x60;type.id&#x60;  &gt; **Note:** &lt;x-lifecycle class&#x3D;\&quot;ea\&quot;&gt;&lt;/x-lifecycle&gt; The ability to search by user classification is available as an [Early Access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature. The &#x60;classification.type&#x60; property cannot be used in conjunction with other search terms. You can search using &#x60;classification.type eq \&quot;LITE\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;classification.type eq \&quot;STANDARD\&quot;&#x60;.  You can also use &#x60;sortBy&#x60; and &#x60;sortOrder&#x60; parameters. The &#x60;ne&#x60; (not equal) operator isn&#39;t supported, but you can obtain the same result by using &#x60;lt ... or ... gt&#x60;. For example, to see all users except those that have a status of &#x60;STAGED&#x60;, use &#x60;(status lt \&quot;STAGED\&quot; or status gt \&quot;STAGED\&quot;)&#x60;.  You can search properties that are arrays. If any element matches the search term, the entire array (object) is returned. Okta follows the [SCIM Protocol Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) for searching arrays. You can search multiple arrays, multiple values in an array, as well as using the standard logical and filtering operators. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter).  Searches for users can be filtered by the following operators: &#x60;sw&#x60;, &#x60;eq&#x60;, and &#x60;co&#x60;. You can only use &#x60;co&#x60; with these select user profile attributes: &#x60;profile.firstName&#x60;, &#x60;profile.lastName&#x60;, &#x60;profile.email&#x60;, and &#x60;profile.login&#x60;.

For example, &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated gt \&quot;2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated%20gt%20%222013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z%22&#x60;. Filtering is case-sensitive for property names and query values, while operators are case-insensitive.  Filtering supports the following limited number of properties: &#x60;status&#x60;, &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;, &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;profile.login&#x60;, &#x60;profile.email&#x60;, &#x60;profile.firstName&#x60;, and &#x60;profile.lastName&#x60;.  Additionally, filtering supports only the equal &#x60;eq&#x60; operator from the standard Okta API filtering semantics, except in the case of the &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60; property. This property can also use the inequality operators (&#x60;gt&#x60;, &#x60;ge&#x60;, &#x60;lt&#x60;, and &#x60;le&#x60;). For logical operators, only the logical operators &#x60;and&#x60; and &#x60;or&#x60; are supported. The &#x60;not&#x60; operator isn&#39;t supported.

        /// <param name="search">Searches for users with a supported filtering expression for most properties. Okta recommends using this parameter for optimal search performance.   &gt; **Note:** Using an overly complex or long search query can result in an error.  This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). Use an ID lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data. Returned users include those with the &#x60;DEPROVISIONED&#x60; status.  Property names in the search parameter are case sensitive, whereas operators (&#x60;eq&#x60;, &#x60;sw&#x60;, and so on) and string values are case insensitive. Unlike with user logins, diacritical marks are significant in search string values: a search for &#x60;isaac.brock&#x60; finds &#x60;Isaac.Brock&#x60;, but doesn&#39;t find a property whose value is &#x60;isáàc.bröck&#x60;.   This operation requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.department eq \&quot;Engineering\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.department%20eq%20%22Engineering%22&#x60;. If you use the special character &#x60;\&quot;&#x60; within a quoted string, it must also be escaped &#x60;\\&#x60; and encoded. For example, &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.lastName eq \&quot;bob\&quot;smith\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;search&#x3D;profile.lastName%20eq%20%22bob%5C%22smith%22&#x60;. See [Special Characters](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#special-characters).  This operation searches many properties:   * Any user profile attribute, including custom-defined attributes   * The top-level properties: &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;status&#x60;, &#x60;created&#x60;, &#x60;activated&#x60;, &#x60;statusChanged&#x60;, and &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;   * The [user type](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/#tag/UserType/operation/updateUserType) accessed as &#x60;type.id&#x60;  &gt; **Note:** &lt;x-lifecycle class&#x3D;\&quot;ea\&quot;&gt;&lt;/x-lifecycle&gt; The ability to search by user classification is available as an [Early Access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature. The &#x60;classification.type&#x60; property cannot be used in conjunction with other search terms. You can search using &#x60;classification.type eq \&quot;LITE\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;classification.type eq \&quot;STANDARD\&quot;&#x60;.  You can also use &#x60;sortBy&#x60; and &#x60;sortOrder&#x60; parameters. The &#x60;ne&#x60; (not equal) operator isn&#39;t supported, but you can obtain the same result by using &#x60;lt ... or ... gt&#x60;. For example, to see all users except those that have a status of &#x60;STAGED&#x60;, use &#x60;(status lt \&quot;STAGED\&quot; or status gt \&quot;STAGED\&quot;)&#x60;.  You can search properties that are arrays. If any element matches the search term, the entire array (object) is returned. Okta follows the [SCIM Protocol Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) for searching arrays. You can search multiple arrays, multiple values in an array, as well as using the standard logical and filtering operators. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter).  Searches for users can be filtered by the following operators: &#x60;sw&#x60;, &#x60;eq&#x60;, and &#x60;co&#x60;. You can only use &#x60;co&#x60; with these select user profile attributes: &#x60;profile.firstName&#x60;, &#x60;profile.lastName&#x60;, &#x60;profile.email&#x60;, and &#x60;profile.login&#x60;.

For example, &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated gt \&quot;2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\&quot;&#x60; is encoded as &#x60;filter&#x3D;lastUpdated%20gt%20%222013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z%22&#x60;. Filtering is case-sensitive for property names and query values, while operators are case-insensitive.  Filtering supports the following limited number of properties: &#x60;status&#x60;, &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60;, &#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;profile.login&#x60;, &#x60;profile.email&#x60;, &#x60;profile.firstName&#x60;, and &#x60;profile.lastName&#x60;.  Additionally, filtering supports only the equal &#x60;eq&#x60; operator from the standard Okta API filtering semantics, except in the case of the &#x60;lastUpdated&#x60; property. This property can also use the inequality operators (&#x60;gt&#x60;, &#x60;ge&#x60;, &#x60;lt&#x60;, and &#x60;le&#x60;). For logical operators, only the logical operators &#x60;and&#x60; and &#x60;or&#x60; are supported. The &#x60;not&#x60; operator isn&#39;t supported. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter) and [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators). (optional)</param>

The value of &#x60;q&#x60; is matched against &#x60;firstName&#x60;, &#x60;lastName&#x60;, or &#x60;email&#x60;.

Within the profile, if the user tries to update the primary or the secondary email IDs, verification emails are sent to those email IDs, and the fields are updated only upon verification.  If you are using this endpoint to set a password, it sets a password without validating existing user credentials. This is an administrative operation. For operations that validate credentials, refer to the [Reset password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/resetPassword), [Start forgot password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/forgotPassword), and [Update password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/changePassword) endpoints.
